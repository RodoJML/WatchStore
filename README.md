    Followed this to install Tailwind
    https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs

    Ran this on SQL workbench to make the SQL authentication work
    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'xxxxxxx';

    cd Documents/Developer/HTML/React/Watch_Store

    Pending to create users and roles into the database, for developer, admin and end-user.
